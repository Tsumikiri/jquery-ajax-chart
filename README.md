# jQuery Ajax Chart Plugin
A jQuery-based wrapper for Google Charts loaded via ajax. Check out the [documentation](https://cdn.rawgit.com/tsumikiri/jquery-ajax-chart/master/index.html)!

## What it Does
This plugin serves as a wrapper for the [Google Charts Library](https://developers.google.com/chart/). Use it to initialize Google Charts with familiar jQuery syntax.

## What it Doesn't Do
You must create your own server-side implementation for serving up [Google Charts DataTable JSON objects](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/reference#dataparam). Usually this involves a server-side scripting language like PHP or Python, some database queries, and a bit of data formatting.
