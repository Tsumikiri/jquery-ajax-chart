# jQuery Ajax Chart Plugin
A jQuery-based wrapper for Google Charts loaded via ajax.

##What does it do?
This plugin serves as a wrapper for the Google Charts Library. Use it to initialize Google Charts with familiar jQuery syntax.

##Caveats
You must create your own server-side implementation for serving Google Charts DataTables. Usually this involves a server-side scripting language like PHP or Python, some database queries, and a bit of data formatting.
